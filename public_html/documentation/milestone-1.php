<strong>Purpose</strong>
<br>
            <li>Purpose of my PWP is to not only educate people (particulary Seniors) about their options for Medicare</li>
            <li>Being an Independent Insurance Broker allows me to be contracted by any Insurance carrier I please, which
            allows me to sign people up for a Medicare plan that best benefits them and their overall health.</li>
            <li>This PWP I would like to be able to get referrals from people in NEw MExico that would like for me to
            come to their home, speak on the phone or virtually and help them sign up for Medicare.</li>
